Javascript Voice Recognition(by Wes Bos 30-day javascript challenge) - Day 20 JS Speech Detection

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript(ES6)
* Default Browser Speech Recognition

## How to Use it:
* Step 1:
  Allow the page to use your microphone
    - Chrome: Icon next to the favorite star in your address bar;
    - Firefox: about:preferences#privacy - add the page on mic privacy preferences
 * Step 2:
  Speak(or put some audio in other languages) and see it going crazy.
 * Step 3:
  To remove the permission for the page to use your mic, go to:
    - Chrome: Icon next to the favorite star on your address bar;
    - Firefox: about:preferences#privacy - remove the page on mic privacy preferences
 
 This is just a silly project made to show what can be done with javascript, and to have a little fun while the speech recognition tries to get what is being said in another language and pass it as yours.
